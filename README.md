## Log

### Sometime 2016
- Bought supplies 
- Wrote a simple program to flash a strip of 10 LED lights

### Oct 21, 2017
- Rewrote the simple program to flash the strip of 10 LED lights
- Bought a digital multimeter as I needed to determine the +/- ends of the External power supply
- Wired up the simple light flashing program with the external power supply.
  - Leds were much brighter
- Setup Git to track my progress so I don't lose it again.

### Oct 22, 2017
- Cut a large piece of poster board to fit inside the wheel of the bike
  - Doesn't fit perfectly but its close and good enough to build with
- Cut a strip of lights to go around the circumference of the wheel, left an extra 2 leds just in case.(119 leds in all)
  - Soldered wires onto that strip of leds so I can power them,
    - I now really wish I would have bought 3 different colors of wire...
- Hooked up the 119 led strip to the arduino board and was able to power them all!

### Nov 5, 2017
- Cut 6 strips of leds, 16 lights per strip
- Attach large piece of poster board to the wheel in progress to provide a flat surface for light attachment
- Remove 3 lights from the 119 led strip that circles the wheel
  - Its now 116 lights.
